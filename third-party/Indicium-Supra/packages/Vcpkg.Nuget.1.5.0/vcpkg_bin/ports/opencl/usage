The package opencl is compatible with built-in CMake targets:

    find_package(OpenCL REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE ${OpenCL_LIBRARIES})
    target_include_directories(main PRIVATE ${OpenCL_INCLUDE_DIRS})

You will also need to install an appropriate driver package from your CPU/GPU manufacturer.
